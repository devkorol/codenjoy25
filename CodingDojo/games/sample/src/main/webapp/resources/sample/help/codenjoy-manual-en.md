## Intro

The game server is available for familiarization reasons
[http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest](http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest).

This is the open source game. To realize your game, correct errors in the current
version and make the other corrections, you should
[fork the project](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy) at first.
There is the description in the Readme.md file in the repository root.
It is specified in the description what to do next.

If any questions, please write in [skype:alexander.baglay](skype:alexander.baglay)
or Email [apofig@gmail.com](mailto:apofig@gmail.com).

Game project (for writing your bot) can be 
found [here](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)

## What the game about?

You have to write your own bot for the hero, which will beat the other bots on points. Everyone plays on the same field. 
The hero can move around the free cells in all four  sides. On his way the hero can meet a bomb, a devil and an enemy. If the hero runs into a bomb, he will die. 
The hero will get bonus points for the worm. He will get penalty points if he dies. 
The points are added up.

The player with the most points wins (before the agreed time). 
The dead hero immediately appears in a new location on the field.

## Connect to the server

So, the player [registers on the server](../../../register?gameName=sample)
and joining the game.

Then you should connect from client code to the server via websockets.
This [collection of clients](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)
for different programming languages will help you. How to start a
client please check at the root of the project in the README.md file.

If you can't find your programming language, you're gonna
have to write your client (and then send us to the mail:
[apofig@gmail.com](mailto:apofig@gmail.com))

Address to connect the game on the server looks like this (you can
copy it from your game room):

`https://[server]/codenjoy-contest/board/player/[user]?code=[code]`

Here `[server]` - domain/id of server, `[user]` is your player id
and `[code]` is your security token. Make sure you keep the code
safe from prying eyes. Any participant, knowing your code, can
play on your behalf.

In the client code, you need to find a similar line and replace it
with your URL - thereby, you set the login / password to access the
server. Then start your client and make sure the server receives
your client's commands. After that, you can start working on the
logic of the bot.

## Message format

After connection, the client will regularly (every second) receive 
a line of characters with the encoded state of the field. The format:

`^board=(.*)$`

You can use this regular expression to extract a board from
the resulting string.

## Field example

Here's a sample line from the server:

<pre> board=☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼ ☻x ☼☼ ☺ ☼☼ $ x ☼☼ $ x ☼☼ ☼☼ $ x $☼☼         x ☼☼ x $ ☼☼ x ☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼ ☼☼ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼ ☼☼ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ $ ☼☼ ☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼ </pre>

The length of the string is equal to the area of the field `N*N`. If you insert a line break character
every `N=sqrt(length(string))` characters, then
you get a readable image of the field:

<pre>☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼
☼          $                 ☼
☼                            ☼
☼   $              $         ☼
☼                       $    ☼
☼  $                         ☼
☼                            ☼
☼        ☻x                  ☼
☼               ☺            ☼
☼        $ x                 ☼
☼        $  x                ☼
☼                            ☼
☼ $         x               $☼
☼         x                  ☼

☼         x                  ☼
☼    $                       ☼
☼                            ☼
☼                       $    ☼
☼                            ☼
☼                            ☼
☼                            ☼
☼            $               ☼
☼                            ☼
☼                            ☼
☼       $                $   ☼
☼                            ☼
☼                $           ☼
☼                            ☼
☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼</pre>

The first character of the line corresponds to the cell located in the upper left corner and has the coordinate `[0, 28]`. 
In this example, the hero's position (symbol `☺`) is `[8, 16]`.

## How to play?

The game is turn-based, every second the server sends your client the state of the updated field for the current moment and waits for the response of the command to the hero. In the next second the player has to manage to give a command to the hero. If he doesn't, the hero stands still.

Your goal is to make the hero move according to your algorithm.
The hero on the field must be able to score as many points as he can.
The main goal of the game is to beat all opponents by points.

## Commands

There are several commands:
* `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` - lead to the movement of the hero in a given direction by 1 cell.
* `ACT` - leave the bomb. 
    Movement commands can be combined with the command `ACT`, 
    separating them with a comma - which means that for one tick of the game will be left bomb, and then the movement `LEFT, ACT` or vice versa `ACT, LEFT`.

## Settings.

The properties will change[(?)](#ask) as the game progresses.
are shown in the table below:

| Event | Title | Points |
|---------|----------|------|
| Points for picked up gold | WIN_SCORE | 30[(?)](#ask)
| Hero death points | LOSE_PENALTY | -20[(?)](#ask)
| Points for winning on the round | WIN_ROUND_SCORE | 100[(?)](#ask)
| Points for killing other hero | KILL_OTHER_HERO_SCORE | 5[(?)](#ask)
| Points for killing hero from other team | KILL_ENEMY_HERO_SCORE | 10[(?)](#ask)
| Counting score mode | SCORE_COUNTING_TYPE | 0 (0 - Accumulate points consistently, 1 - Maximum points from the event, 2 - Maximum points from the series)[(?)](#ask) |

## Cases

## Hints

The first task is to write a websocket client that connects to the server. 
Then get the hero on the field to obey commands.
This will prepare the player for the main game.
The primary goal is to run a meaningful game and win.

If you don't know where to start, try implementing the following algorithms:

* Proceed to any open cell on the field.
* Try not to get blown up by a bomb.
* Place a bomb in the current cell, blocking the path of your opponents.
* Find the nearest gold and pick it up.

## FAQ

## <a id="ask"></a> Ask Sensei

You can always see the settings of the current game
[here](/codenjoy-contest/rest/settings/player).
Please ask Sensei about current game settings. You can find Sensei in
the chat that the organizers have provided to discuss issues.

## Client and API

The organizers provide players with prepared clients in the source
code in several languages. Each of these clients already knows how to communicate
with the server, receive and parse messages from the server (usually called a board)
and send commands to the server.

The client code doesn't give too much of a head start to the players because this code
still needs to be sorted out, but there is some logic to communicate with the server +
some high-level API to work with the board (which is already nice).

All languages in one way or another have a similar set of methods:

* `Solver`.
  An empty class with one method - you have to fill it with clever logic.
* `Direcion`.
  Possible directions of movement for this game.
* `Point`
  `x`, `y` coordinates.
* `Element`.
  Type of element on the board.
* `Board`.
  Contains logic for easy search and manipulation of elements on the board.
  You can find the following methods in the Board class:
* `int boardSize();`
  Board size.
* `boolean isAt(Point point, Element element);`
  Is the given element at the point position?
* `boolean isAt(Point point, Collection<Element>elements);`
  Is there anything from the given set at the point position?
* `boolean isNear(Point point, Element element);`
  Is there a given element around the cell with the point coordinate?
* `int countNear(Point point, Element element);`
  How many elements of the given type are there around the cell with point?
* `Element getAt(Point point);`
  Element in the current cell.
* and so on...

## Want to host an event?

It's an open source game. To implement your version of it,
to fix bugs and to add any other logic simply
[fork it](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy.git).
All instructions are in Readme.md file, you'll know what to do 
next once you read it.

Good luck and may the best win!
