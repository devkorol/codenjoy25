## What the game about?

You have to write your own bot for the hero, which will beat the other bots on points. Everyone plays on the same field. 
The hero can move around the free cells in all four  sides. On his way the hero can meet a bomb, a devil and an enemy. If the hero runs into a bomb, he will die. 
The hero will get bonus points for the worm. He will get penalty points if he dies. 
The points are added up.

The player with the most points wins (before the agreed time). 
The dead hero immediately appears in a new location on the field.
