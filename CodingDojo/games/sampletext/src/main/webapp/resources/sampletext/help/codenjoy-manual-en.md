## Intro

The game server is available for familiarization reasons
[http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest](http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest).

This is the open source game. To realize your game, correct errors in the current
version and make the other corrections, you should
[fork the project](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy) at first.
There is the description in the Readme.md file in the repository root.
It is specified in the description what to do next.

If any questions, please write in [skype:alexander.baglay](skype:alexander.baglay)
or Email [apofig@gmail.com](mailto:apofig@gmail.com).

Game project (for writing your bot) can be 
found [here](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)

## What the game about?

You have to write your own bot for the hero, which will beat the other bots on points. Everyone plays on the same field. 
The hero can move around the free cells in all four  sides. On his way the hero can meet a bomb, a devil and an enemy. If the hero runs into a bomb, he will die. 
The hero will get bonus points for the worm. He will get penalty points if he dies. 
The points are added up.

The player with the most points wins (before the agreed time). 
The dead hero immediately appears in a new location on the field.

## Connect to the server

So, the player [registers on the server](../../../register?gameName=sampletext)
and joining the game.

Then you should connect from client code to the server via websockets.
This [collection of clients](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)
for different programming languages will help you. How to start a
client please check at the root of the project in the README.md file.

If you can't find your programming language, you're gonna
have to write your client (and then send us to the mail:
[apofig@gmail.com](mailto:apofig@gmail.com))

Address to connect the game on the server looks like this (you can
copy it from your game room):

`https://[server]/codenjoy-contest/board/player/[user]?code=[code]`

Here `[server]` - domain/id of server, `[user]` is your player id
and `[code]` is your security token. Make sure you keep the code
safe from prying eyes. Any participant, knowing your code, can
play on your behalf.

In the client code, you need to find a similar line and replace it
with your URL - thereby, you set the login / password to access the
server. Then start your client and make sure the server receives
your client's commands. After that, you can start working on the
logic of the bot.

## Message Format

The player receives every second a question from the server to which he must give an answer.
If the answer to the question is correct, the `valid` field will be set to `true`.
If the answer to the question is wrong, the `valid` field will be set to `false`.
BoardData json includes a history of questions with player answers and a pointer 
to the next question.

## Example query

## Symbol breakdown

## How do you play?

The game is turn-based, every second the server sends your client
the state of the updated field for the current moment and waits for a response
command to the hero. In the next second, the player has to give
command to the hero. If he doesn't, the hero stands still.

Your goal is to make the hero move according to your algorithm.
The hero on the field must be able to score as many points as he can.
The main goal of the game is to beat all opponents by points.

## Commands

There are several commands:

TODO

## Settings

The settings will change[(?)](#ask) as the game progresses.

## Cases

## Hints

The first task is to write a websocket client that connects to the server. Then get the hero on the field to obey commands.
This will prepare the player for the main game.
The main goal is to play a meaningful game and win.

## <a id="ask"></a> Ask Sensei

You can always see the settings of the current game
[here](/codenjoy-contest/rest/settings/player).
Please ask Sensei about current game settings. You can find Sensei in
the chat that the organizers have provided to discuss issues.

## Client and API

The organizers provide the players with prepared clients in source code in several languages. Each of these clients already knows how to contact the server, receive and parse messages from the server (usually called board) and send commands to the server.

The client code doesn't give too much help to the players because this code still needs to be understood, but there is some logic behind communicating with the server + some high-level API to work with the board (which is already nice).

All languages in one way or another have a similar set of methods:

* `Solver`.
  An empty class with one method - you have to fill it with clever logic.
* `Board`.
  Contains logic for easy search and manipulation of elements on the board.
* and so on...


## Want to host an event?

It's an open source game. To implement your version of it,
to fix bugs and to add any other logic simply
[fork it](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy.git).
All instructions are in Readme.md file, you'll know what to do 
next once you read it.

Good luck and may the best win!
