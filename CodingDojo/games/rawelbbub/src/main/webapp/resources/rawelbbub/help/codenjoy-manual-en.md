## Intro

The game server is available for familiarization reasons
[http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest](http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest).

This is the open source game. To realize your game, correct errors in the current
version and make the other corrections, you should
[fork the project](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy) at first.
There is the description in the Readme.md file in the repository root.
It is specified in the description what to do next.

If any questions, please write in [skype:alexander.baglay](skype:alexander.baglay)
or Email [apofig@gmail.com](mailto:apofig@gmail.com).

Game project (for writing your bot) can be 
found [here](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)

## What is the game about

You have to write your own bot for the hero that beats the other bots
on points. The whole game takes place on the same field. The hero can
move around the free cells in all four directions.
The hero can also shoot a torpedo, which explodes when
hit an obstacle. The torpedo moves twice as fast as the hero.

The player's bot receives points[*] (#ask) for killing enemies. 
Penalty points[(?)](#ask) are awarded for the hero's death. 

The dead hero immediately appears in a random location on the field.

In addition to normal enemy submarines, there are prize submarines. In order to destroy
such a hero must be hit several[(?)](#ask) times. After you have killed 
prize submarine a prize will fall from it, which must be picked up. If 
do not do this, after some time [(?)](#ask) it will disappear. 
The player also receives points[(?)](#ask) for killing the prize submarine. 
Be careful, the prize can be accidentally destroyed by a torpedo. 
if this happens, it will also disappear from the field.

There are several types of prizes. Each of which temporarily gives the hero
a certain advantage for a time:

* Picked up during the game prize `PRIZE_IMMORTALITY` makes the hero 
  invulnerable to enemy torpedoes. 
* And the prize `PRIZE_WALKING_ON_FISHNET` gives the hero the ability to walk through fishing nets. 
* The prize `PRIZE_BREAKING_BAD` will allow you to pierce icebergs and impassable reefs. 
* The prize `PRIZE_VISIBILITY` gives the ability to hide equipment in the seaweed. 
* The prize `PRIZE_NO_SLIDING` gives the ability to prevent skidding while passing
  oil spill. If the action of the prize is over and the hero is 
  among the oil, it will be as if the hero just swam there.

The prize lasts for some time. Every even tick of the game the prize 'flickers' with the `PRIZE' symbol.

The points are added up. The player with the most points (before the agreed 
time).

[(?)](#ask)The exact number of points for any action as well as other 
settings at this point in the game, check with Sensei.

## Connect to the server

So, the player [registers on the server](../../../register?gameName=rawelbbub)
and joining the game.

Then you should connect from client code to the server via websockets.
This [collection of clients](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)
for different programming languages will help you. How to start a
client please check at the root of the project in the README.md file.

If you can't find your programming language, you're gonna
have to write your client (and then send us to the mail:
[apofig@gmail.com](mailto:apofig@gmail.com))

Address to connect the game on the server looks like this (you can
copy it from your game room):

`https://[server]/codenjoy-contest/board/player/[user]?code=[code]`

Here `[server]` - domain/id of server, `[user]` is your player id
and `[code]` is your security token. Make sure you keep the code
safe from prying eyes. Any participant, knowing your code, can
play on your behalf.

In the client code, you need to find a similar line and replace it
with your URL - thereby, you set the login / password to access the
server. Then start your client and make sure the server receives
your client's commands. After that, you can start working on the
logic of the bot.

## Message format

After connection, the client will regularly (every second) receive 
a line of characters with the encoded state of the field. The format:

`^board=(.*)$`

You can use this regular expression to extract a board from
the resulting string.

## Field example

Here is an example of a line from the server:

<pre>board=☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬˅╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬˂╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ _COPY2 ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬-╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ╠ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ╬▲╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼☼ ☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼</pre>

The length of the string is equal to the area of the field `N*N`. If you insert a character
every `N=sqrt(length(string))` characters, then
you get a readable image of the field:


<pre>☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼
☼ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬˅╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬˂╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬-╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╠ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ╬▲╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ╬ ☼
☼ ☼
☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼</pre>


The first character of the line corresponds to the cell located in the
The coordinate is `[0, 29]`.
The coordinate `[0, 0]` corresponds to the lower left corner.
In this example the hero's position (symbol `▲`) is `[3, 2]`, 
and the torpedo (symbol `-`) is `[11, 7]`.

## How to play?

The game is turn-based, every second the server sends your client
the state of the updated field for the current moment and waits for a response
command to the hero. In the next second, the player has to give
command to the hero. If he doesn't, the hero stands still.

Your goal is to make the hero move according to your algorithm.
The hero on the field must be able to score as many points as he can.
The main goal of the game is to beat all opponents by points.

## Control Commands

There are several commands and they depend on the display/control format 
of the game, as chosen by Sensei at the time of the game:

* In the classic overhead view mode, the move command does 
  exactly what it says:  

  + `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` - lead to a simultaneous turn and
    move the hero in a given direction by 1 cell.
  + `ACT` - torpedo shot. 
  + Movement commands can be combined with the shot commands, 
    separated by a comma - which means that in one tick of the game 
    there will be a shot and then movement `LEFT,ACT` or vice versa `ACT,LEFT`.
  
* In the game mode "TURN/FORWARD" the view on the field is the same from above, but the control of the hero
  is slightly different and is divided into turn commands and movement commands: 

  + `UP` - "full forward" causes the hero to move one cell 
    forward in the direction of movement.
  + `DOWN` - "reverse" causes the hero to move one cell 
    to the opposite side of the direction of movement.
  + `LEFT` - "turn left" causes the hero to turn clockwise 
    clockwise by 90 degrees.
  + `RIGHT` - "turn to the right" causes the hero to turn counter 
    clockwise by 90 degrees.

* In the "Side View" game mode, the view on the field, oddly enough, is from the side, and controlling the
  the hero is possible in the format of dive / surfacing and movement to the left / right:  

  + `UP` - "surfacing" causes the hero to move one cell up
    without changing his original direction.
  + `DOWN` - "dive" moves the hero one cell down
    without changing his original direction.
  + `LEFT` - causes the hero to turn and move 1 cell to the left.
  + `RIGHT` - causes the hero to turn and move 1 cell to the right.
  
## Settings

The settings will change[(?)](#ask) as the game progresses.

## Cases

## Hints

The first task is to write a websocket client that will connect
to the server. Then get the hero to obey commands. In this way,
the player will be prepared for tomorrow's game. The second task is to play
a meaningful game and win.

If you don't know where to start, try implementing the following algorithms:

* Move to a random empty adjacent cell.
* Move forward into an empty cell in the direction of the nearest prize.
* Try to hide from torpedoes.
* Try to avoid enemy submarines and other heroes.
* Try to shoot at other heroes.

## FAQ

## <a id="ask"></a> Ask Sensei

You can always see the settings of the current game
[here](/codenjoy-contest/rest/settings/player).
Please ask Sensei about current game settings. You can find Sensei in
the chat that the organizers have provided to discuss issues.

## Client and API

The organizers provide players with prepared clients in the source 
code in several languages. Each of these clients already knows how to communicate 
with the server, receive and parse messages from the server (usually called a board)
and send commands to the server.

The client code doesn't give too much of a head start to the players because this code
still needs to be sorted out, but there is some logic to communicate with the server +
some high-level API to work with the board (which is already nice).

All languages in one way or another have a similar set of methods:

* `Solver`.
  An empty class with one method - you have to fill it with clever logic.
* `Direcion`.
  Possible directions of movement for this game.
* `Point`
  `x`, `y` coordinates.
* `Element`.
  Type of element on the board.
* `Board`. 
  Contains logic for easy search and manipulation of elements on the board.
  You can find the following methods in the Board class:
* `int boardSize();`
  Board size.
* `boolean isAt(Point point, Element element);`
  Is the given element at the point position?
* `boolean isAt(Point point, Collection<Element>elements);`
  Is there anything from the given set at the point position?
* `boolean isNear(Point point, Element element);`
  Is there a given element around the cell with the point coordinate?
* `int countNear(Point point, Element element);`
  How many elements of the given type are there around the cell with point?
* `Element getAt(Point point);`
  Element in the current cell.

## Want to host an event?

It's an open source game. To implement your version of it,
to fix bugs and to add any other logic simply
[fork it](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy.git).
All instructions are in Readme.md file, you'll know what to do 
next once you read it.
