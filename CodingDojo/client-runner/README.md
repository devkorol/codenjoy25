# CODENJOY Solution Runner
Makes possible to store [Codenjoy](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy) players solutions and check them in isolated manner. 

## Introduction
For many and many years [Codenjoy](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy) players had to configure and run their game clients locally.
The clients should connect to a game server via websockets and try to pass a level using player's 
custom implementation of an algorithm. In such circumstances there are some problems.
One of them is an inability to save the history of attempts in one place, and another one,
which is more important, even if it could be possible, 
we can not be sure if the attempts are successful of not until we launch them by ourselves.

So this application is intended to solve these problems described above. It 
brings Codenjoy and its users several new opportunities. For example, 
Codenjoy now could be also a _testing and hiring system_ for modern and progressive
companies and teams.

## How it works
The app uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for its purposes. 
It consumes requests that contains URL of public Git repository with a player's solution
and link to Codenjoy server with the player's id and code. Further, it pulls the solution 
from master branch of the repo, save it locally with, build it and run it in new separate 
Docker container. Build and runtime logs accumulate in the solution folder and can be given 
to front-end.

## How to run
### Run with Maven right on the local host
The command below will build the application using Maven and run in right on the local host:
```
$ sh ./build/run_with_maven_war.sh
```
or
```
$ sh ./build/run_with_maven_spring.sh
```
For configuring application's behaviour you can set these environment variables.

Variable | Defaults | Description
---------|:----------:|------------
`context` | /client-runner | Web application context
`server.port` | 8081 | Web application port
`service.solutions.path` | ./solutions | Where to store downloaded solutions
`service.solutions.pattern` | yyyy-MM-dd'_'HH-mm-ss | How to name each solution folder
`docker.container.memoryLimitMB` | 0 | [Memory limit in MB](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
`docker.container.cpuPeriod` | 100000 | [Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
`docker.container.cpuQuota` | -1 | [Limit the CPU CFS quota](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)

### Run in Docker container  __[Recommended]__
The command below will build and start a container with the app and with
default config:
```
$ sh ./build/run_with_docker-compose.sh
```
For configuring container's port or folder path, where solutions will be stored,
change `docker-compose/.env` file:
```
$ nano ./docker-compose/.env
```
For configuring application's behaviour,
change `docker-compose/client-runner.env` file with variables from the table above:
```
& nano ./docker-compose/client-runner.env
```

## Client platforms support
At the moment solution runner supports client, written in:
- Java with Maven
- Ruby 
- Python
- JavaScript (Node.js)

### How to add a new platform support 
There are an enum class `com.codenjoy.clientrunner.model.Platform`
and folder with dockerfiles in `src/main/resources`. In order to add support for
another platform, you should define this platform in the enum following already existing
principle, and after that create valid Dockerfile and store it in 
`src/main/resources/dockerfiles/<platform_name_lowercase>/Dockerfile`.

For example, lets add Python support (which is already added, of course):
1. In `com.codenjoy.clientrunner.model.Platform` write `PYTHON("main.py")`, where 
`"main.py"` is Python-specific project file which helps
   client runner automatically detect incoming solution's platform.
    
2. Create new Dockerfile and store it in `src/main/resources/dockerfiles/python/Dockerfile`:
```
FROM python:3

ARG CODENJOY_URL
ENV CODENJOY_URL_VAR=$CODENJOY_URL

COPY . /app

ENTRYPOINT python -u /app/main.py "${CODENJOY_URL_VAR}"
```
_Pay attention that there is necessary `CODENJOY_URL` argument which is URL with a player's id and code. It's automatically 
passed to all launched clients._
